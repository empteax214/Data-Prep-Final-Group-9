# Data-Prep-Final-Group-9-DSEB64B
In this project, we worked with the Home Credit Default Risk dataset. This includes EDA for all tables, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameters tuning. 
Except for application_train_test's feature engineering process, all of the jupyter notebooks are created and modified on kaggle. We have publicized all the datasets linked to the notebooks.
