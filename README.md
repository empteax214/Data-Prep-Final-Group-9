# Group-9-DSEB64B-Home-Credit-Default-Risk
This is the final project for Data Preparation & Visualization course. In this project, we worked with the Home Credit Default Risk dataset. This includes EDA for all tables, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameters tuning.

Except for application_train_test's feature engineering process, all of the jupyter notebooks are created and modified on kaggle. We have publicized all the datasets linked to the notebooks.
